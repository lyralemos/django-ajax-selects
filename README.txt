This project is a fork of http://code.google.com/p/django-ajax-selects/ altered to be compatible with django 1.3, specially staticfiles.

Enables editing of `ForeignKey`, `ManyToMany` and simple text fields using the Autocomplete - `jQuery` plugin.

django-ajax-selects will work in any normal form as well as in the admin.
